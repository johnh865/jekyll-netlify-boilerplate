# Americans For Representation

## Our Broken Government

We all know something is wrong with government. The Economist calls our government a “flawed democracy”. According to Gallup, “Only 28% of Americans have a positive overall view of the US federal government… That was the lowest rating for any business or industry sector”. Mechanisms such as money in politics, the electoral college, and gerrymandering have corrupted our democracy. But what can we do to fix America? 

The **Americans for Representation (AFR)** is a nonprofit, cooperatively owned advocacy group that seeks to empower American voters by organizing people into collective power that our politicians cannot afford to ignore. With this power we seek to reform our democracy and repair America. We believe that:

  - We should strive for political equality for all Americans.
  - The barriers to democratic participation should be as low as possible.
  - We can make American government better - more responsive, more representative, and more satisfactory for everyone. 

# Grassroots Driven Advocacy

## Trustworthy Advocacy

We have the ability to make a difference by voting and talking with our congressmen. But our individual efforts are not enough. To win battles, allies must organize into a cohesive, united coalition. To win in politics, we must:

  - Organize together to strategically vote in unison at all levels of local, state, and federal government.

  -	Send our true representatives to speak to politicians and extract tit-for-tat exchanges in favor of our desired policy, using our collective votes and donations as leverage.

This is the same strategy special interests use to lobby our government. It’s time for ordinary Americans to harness this power. However in order to create this power, we need a new political organization that Americans can trust. We need a cooperatively owned political group. 

## Cooperative Ownership

The Americans for Representation (AFR) is a cooperatively owned political group that seeks to be a trustworthy advocate for all Americans. In order to create trust, the AFR gives its members **democratic ownership** of the organization.

This means that you and other members legally own the AFR rather than some private benefactor. This means that all members elect, hire, and fire the leadership at will. Electoral power ensures that your interests will be advocated for rather than the interests of the leadership. Membership will also be open to all citizens who wish to participate. With cooperative ownership, you will drive the organization’s goals from the bottom up. 

## AFR Member Services

The AFR will provide several services for its members. It will: 
  *	**Provide true democratic representation.** Through democratic ownership, AFR members will elect representative leadership - leaders that can be trusted - leaders with a much shorter leash than the politicians in Washington.

  *	**Become a lobbying firm.** The AFR will fight fire-with-fire and arm Americans with the same tools that special interests have used to corrupt our government. 

  *	**Provide members actionable news & information** on issues and strategic voting in order to maximize voter influence.

  *	**Nominate our members as candidates** in Republican and Democratic primaries.

The AFR will not exclusively support one party. The AFR will choose its support strategically with the goal of maximizing our members’ political power and influence.

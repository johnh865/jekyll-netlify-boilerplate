## Americans For Representation

### Our Broken Government

We all know something is wrong with government. The Economist calls our government a “flawed democracy”. According to Gallup, “Only 28% of Americans have a positive overall view of the US federal government… That was the lowest rating for any business or industry sector”. Mechanisms such as money in politics, the electoral college, and gerrymandering have corrupted our democracy. But what can we do to fix America? 

The **Americans for Representation (AFR)** is a nonprofit, cooperatively owned advocacy group that seeks to empower American voters by organizing people into collective power that our politicians cannot afford to ignore. With this power we seek to reform our democracy and repair America. We believe that:

* We should strive for political equality for all Americans.
* The barriers to democratic participation should be as low as possible.
* We can make American government better - more responsive, more representative, and more satisfactory for everyone. 

## Grassroots Driven Advocacy

### Trustworthy Advocacy

We have the ability to make a difference by voting and talking with our congressmen. But our individual efforts are not enough. To win battles, allies must organize into a cohesive, united coalition. To win in politics, we must:

* Organize together to strategically vote in unison at all levels of local, state, and federal government.
*	Send our true representatives to speak to politicians and extract tit-for-tat exchanges in favor of our desired policy, using our collective votes and donations as leverage.

This is the same strategy special interests use to lobby our government. It’s time for ordinary Americans to harness this power. However in order to create this power, we need a new political organization that Americans can trust. We need a cooperatively owned political group. 

### Cooperative Ownership

The Americans for Representation (AFR) is a cooperatively owned political group that seeks to be a trustworthy advocate for all Americans. In order to create trust, the AFR gives its members **democratic ownership** of the organization.

This means that you and other members legally own the AFR rather than some private benefactor. This means that all members elect, hire, and fire the leadership at will. Electoral power ensures that your interests will be advocated for rather than the interests of the leadership. Membership will also be open to all citizens who wish to participate. With cooperative ownership, you will drive the organization’s goals from the bottom up. 

### AFR Member Services

The AFR will provide several services for its members. It will: 
*	**Provide true democratic representation.** Through democratic ownership, AFR members will elect representative leadership - leaders that can be trusted - leaders with a much shorter leash than the politicians in Washington.

*	**Become a lobbying firm.** The AFR will fight fire-with-fire and arm Americans with the same tools that special interests have used to corrupt our government. 

*	**Provide members actionable news & information** on issues and strategic voting in order to maximize voter influence.

*	**Nominate our members as candidates** in Republican and Democratic primaries.

The AFR will not exclusively support one party. The AFR will choose its support strategically with the goal of maximizing our members’ political power and influence. 

## Reforming Government

### Disrupting the Two Party System

Americans are dissatisfied with both parties and must resort to picking the lesser of two evils for every election. Gerrymandering, convoluted party primaries, and the exorbitant cost of political campaigning all work to disempower the working and professional class. The AFR will work to eliminate these barriers to participation. 

The two-party system has also produced decades of political stalemate, polarization and voter dissatisfaction. Many political scientists believe that this stalemate is an inevitable consequence of our winner-takes-all election system. However, solutions have already been developed to fix these problems.

### Electoral Reform

Political scientists have devised many innovative ideas that could be used to repair our democracy and advance 3rd party participation. These include:

*	Proportional representation - Representatives are elected to congress based on vote proportion rather than arbitrary district boundaries. 

*	Score based voting - an alternative voting system where voters score each candidate, and the candidate with the greatest score wins.


*	Delegative “liquid” democracy - A mode of governance where voters can choose to delegate out their votes to representatives. Or, voters can choose to directly vote. In other words, you can choose whether you want to directly participate or you want to delegate out your authority.

The AFR seeks to create the best possible American democracy. The AFR shall test and validate potential reforms on its own internal election system. After experimentation, validation, and approval by our members, the AFR will then lobby government to implement these new reforms.  

### Creating a New Consensus

We believe that special interests are largely to blame for the fracture of American society. Americans are not so different from one another. Yet mass media and partisan talking heads pit father against son, mother against daughter, and neighbor against neighbor.

The AFR seeks to construct a new political forum where people can come together to rationally discuss our interests and make the necessary compromises to make a better society. At the very least, we all need to reach a new understanding and trust of each other, even if we cannot agree to the details of policy and ideology. 

Only with a new consensus can we can finally enact the necessary reforms that our current politicians cannot.  

### A Call for Membership 

We want liberals. We want conservatives. We want libertarians. We want socialists. We want the selfish and the selfless. We want to empower everyone as a rising tide lifts all boats. We want your **active participation**. If you think America can do better, please join our group!
